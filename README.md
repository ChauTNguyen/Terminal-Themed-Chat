A simple chat application created by following <http://socket.io/get-started/chat/>.

I wanted to make a terminal-themed chat, and so I improved the application a lot for fun.

Some of the ideas to improve the application (given by socket.io) were implemented:

> Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
> Show who's online.
> Add private messaging.
> Append the message directly as soon as the user presses enter.
> Add support for nicknames.

To install the dependencies required...
> npm install
